# DataScienceEcosystem

GitHub isn't recognizing the ".ipynb" file. Aparently, it's a known issue:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62878732/how-to-display-a-ipynb-file-on-github

I have tried:
1. "DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb" -> error
2. "lab.ipynb" (maybe with a simple name could work) -> error
3. "lab.html" (at least to permite you see the lab, but it doesn't give a friendly view
4. "lab.md" (best way I found to permit you see the lab)

Please, let me know if there's a way to handle this issue.
